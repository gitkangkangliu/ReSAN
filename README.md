# Reinforced Self-Attention Network (ReSAN)

* The repository is the experimental codes for [Title]()
* All codes is implemented with Python under Deep Learning framework Tensorflow.
* The leaderboard of Stanford Natural Language Inference is available [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).
* Please contact author or open an issue for questions and suggestions.


**News: A time- and memory-efficient self-attention mechanism named as Fast-DiSA has been proposed, which is as fast as multi-head self-attention but uses the multi-dim and positional masks techniques. The codes are released at [here](https://github.com/taoshen58/DiSAN/tree/master/Fast-DiSA)**

## Programming Framework for SNLI or SICK

We first demonstrate the file directory tree of all these projects:

```
ROOT
--dataset[d]
----glove[d]
----$task_dataset_name$[d]
--pretrained_model [d]
--src[d]
----model[d]
------template.py[f]
------$model_name$.py[f]
----nn_utils[d]
----utils[d]
------file.py[f]
------nlp.py[f]
------record_log.py[f]
------time_counter.py[f]
----dataset.py[f]

--result[d]
----processed_data[d]

------$model_specific_dir$[d]

--------log_files[d]
--------summary[d]
--------answer[d]
--configs.py[f]
--$task$_main.py[f]
--$task$_log_analysis.py[f]
```

Note: The result dir will appear after the first running.

We elaborate on the every files[f] and directory[d] as follows:

`./configs.py`: perform the parameters parsing and definitions and declarations of global variables, e.g., parameter definition/default value, name(of train/dev/test_data, model, processed_data, ckpt etc.) definitions, directories(of data, result, `$model_specific_dir$` etc.) definitions and corresponding paths generation. 

`./$task$_main.py`: this is the main entry python script to run the project;

`./$task$_log_analysis.py`: this provides a function to analyze the log file of training process. 

`./dataset/`: this is the directory including datasets for current project.

* `./dataset/glove`: including pre-trained glove file
* `./dataset/$task_dataset_name$/`: This is the dataset dir for current task, we will concretely introduce this in each project dir.

`./pretrained_model/`: this is the directory including the default pretrained supervised learning network checkpoints for corresponding base name.

`./src`: dir including python scripts

* `./src/dataset.py`: a class to process raw data from dataset, including data tokenization, token dictionary generation, data digitization, neural network data generation. In addition, there are also some method: `generate_batch_sample_iter` for random mini-batch iteration, `get_statistic` for sentence length statistics and a interface for deleting samples with long sentence in training data.
* `./src/evaluator.py`: a class for model evaluation.
* `./src/graph_handler.py`: a class for handling graph: session initialization, summary saving, model restore etc.
* `./src/perform_recoder.py`: a class to save top-n dev accuracy model checkpoint for future loading.
* `./src/model/`: the dir including tensorflow model file
* `./src/model/template.py`: a abstract python class, including network placeholders, global tensorflow tensor variables, TF loss function, TF accuracy function, EMA for learnable variables and summary, training operation, feed dict generation and training step function. 
* `./src/model/$model_name$.py`: Main TF neural network model, implement the abstract interface `build_network`, extending from `template.py`.
* `./src/nn_utils/`: a package include various tensorflow layers implemented by this repo author.

* `./src/utils/nlp.py`: natural language processing functions.
* `./src/utils/record_log.py`: a log recorder class, and a corresponding instance for all use in current project.
* `./src/utils/time_counter.py`: time counter class to collect the training time, note this time exclude the process to prepare data but only the time spending in training step.

`./result/`: a dir to place the results.

* `./result/processed_data/`: a dir to place Dataset instance with pickle format. The file name is generated by `get_params_str` in `./config.py` according to the related parameters.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/`: the name of this dir is generated by `get_params_str` in `./config.py` according to the related parameters, to save the result for a combination of the parameters. In other words, we associate a dir for a combination of the parameters.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/ckpt/`: a dir to save top-n model checkpoints.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/log_files/`: a dir to save log file.

**Note** that due to too many codes this repo includes, it is inevitable that there are some wrong when I organize the projects into this repo. If you confront some bugs or errors when running the codes, please feel free to report them by opening a issues. I will reply it ASAP.
